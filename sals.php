		<p>My name is Salman Gholizadeh and I'm a selftaught programmer. Doostr.com is an image sharing web-application. Its my first project that I started to be able to exercise on the things 
		I've learned during my studies and learn new technologies. The entire site is programmed by me. That includes server configuration(linux), mySQL relational databases, Object oriented PHP, 
		Javascript (jQuery library), CSS and HTML. I've up until recently (about five months) actively worked on the site inbetween working hours. It's still in early beta and will continue to be 
		so for quite some time since I have other obligation to tend to. I'm also preparing myself to start applying for a job as a programmer. 
		Wish me good luck.

				I'm trying to integrate the site with other social medias such as twitter and facebook. People should be able to upload and share images just by clicking a button. So much work so little time.
